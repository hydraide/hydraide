## 🧠 What is HydrAIDE?

**One engine that replaces your database, cache, and pub/sub — just save your structs.**

No schema design. No queries. No cleanup scripts.
HydrAIDE automatically handles persistence, real-time events, distribution, and memory for you.

For developers who want:

* **Less code and infrastructure** — everything in one place
* **Instant data access** with O(1) folder-based routing
* **Native reactivity** — every change emits a real-time event
* **Memory-efficient operation** — data only lives in RAM when needed
* **Safe concurrency** — built-in per-key distributed locking

With HydrAIDE, you don’t adapt to the database — **the database adapts to your intent**.

### 💖 Thank You, Community!

When we envisioned HydrAIDE, our goal was to give developers a whole new way of thinking... A tool that doesn’t set limits, but unlocks possibilities.

Over the past weeks, it’s been truly incredible to see so many of you discover, understand, and embrace this philosophy. 
Every single star represents your trust, curiosity, and a shared desire to build something new and better.

This chart is not just numbers. Every point is someone’s decision to give HydrAIDE a chance. 
And to us, that’s the greatest recognition we could receive.

Thank you for being part of this journey!   
The best is yet to come…

## 🤖 ChatGPT Support: Learn & Build with HydrAIDE Faster

The HydrAIDE documentation is purposefully structured to make it **fully compatible with LLM-based assistants like ChatGPT** — so you can focus on building instead of spending hours reading.

> ⚠️ HydrAIDE was **not created using ChatGPT or any LLM**.
> It is the result of years of real-world engineering experience.
> However, we believe in **leveraging AI tools wherever they can accelerate your work** — especially when learning new architectures or building production-grade systems.

### ✅ Turn ChatGPT into your personal HydrAIDE expert

To do that, simply create a **ChatGPT project**, and upload the following files:

| File Type             | Path                                                                                |
| --------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Installation Guide    | [HydrAIDE installation guide](docs/install/README.md)                               |
| LLM-Friendly Q\&A Set | [hydraide-questions-answers-for-llm.md](docs/hydraide-questions-answers-for-llm.md) |
| Go SDK Documentation  | [go-sdk.md](docs/sdk/go/go-sdk.md)                                                  |
| Go Example Models     | All `.go` files from [models](docs/sdk/go/examples/models)                          |
| Go SDK Core Logic     | [hydraidego.go](sdk/go/hydraidego/hydraidego.go)                                    |

Once uploaded, ChatGPT will be able to:

* answer **any question** about HydrAIDE’s architecture or APIs,
* help you **write HydrAIDE-style Go code** interactively,
* explain example models, functions, and patterns,
* and guide you through debugging, architecture design, or optimization steps.

💡 The documentation is written to be **semantically consumable by AI**, which means ChatGPT will understand not just APIs, but **the design philosophy, naming logic, and intent** behind each HydrAIDE feature.

> A prebuilt ChatGPT is also available for the HydrAIDE Knowledge Engine. You can use it via the ChatGPT store
or directly through this link: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-688779751c988191b975beaf7f68801d-hydraide-knowledge-engine
Feel free to ask it anything! If it can’t answer your question, open an issue, or build your own custom GPT project
with enhanced responses, as we described above.
