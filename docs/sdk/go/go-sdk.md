## üîå Connect to the HydrAIDE Server Using the SDK

The first and most essential step is establishing a connection to the HydrAIDE server using the Go SDK.

To do this, implement the `repo` package. This package is typically placed under `/utils/repo` and should be 
initialized during your application's startup sequence.

You can find the repo implementation and usage examples here:

üìÅ [`repo.go`](../../../sdk/go/hydraidego/utils/repo/repo.go)

### How to Start Your Server Using the Repo Package

For a complete working example of how to initialize and run your service using the `repo` package, take a look at the demo application:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è [`main.go` in app-queue](examples/applications/app-queue/main.go)m a minimal end-to-end example of SDK setup and Swamp registration with a queue service

## üì¶ At a Glance

Below you'll find a wide range of examples and documentation ‚Äî including complete Go files and ready-made solutions ‚Äî showing how to use the SDK in **production-ready applications**.

---

## üß≠ Naming Conventions

HydrAIDE uses a structured three-level naming system to deterministically route, organize, and store data across distributed servers ‚Äî without requiring coordination or a central orchestrator.

Each data location is uniquely identified using a **Name**, which follows the pattern:

```
Sanctuary ‚Üí Realm ‚Üí Swamp
```

This naming hierarchy allows HydrAIDE to:

* Automatically map names to consistent server locations (using `GetIslandID`)
* Create predictable folder paths on disk
* Enable stateless client-side routing
* Keep lookup performance at **O(1)** regardless of system size

### ‚úÖ Basic Example

```go
name := name.New().
    Sanctuary("users").
    Realm("profiles").
    Swamp("alice123")

fmt.Println(name.Get())            // users/profiles/alice123
fmt.Println(name.GetIslandID(100)) // e.g. 42
```

This name will deterministically map to one of 100 Islands (physical folders or servers). 
It always resolves to the **same target** for the same input, across all clients.

### üö´ Constraints

To keep routing fast and deterministic, **names must follow strict constraints**:

* All three components (`Sanctuary`, `Realm`, `Swamp`) are **required**
* Each component must be at least **1 character long**
* The `/` character is **not allowed** in any part of the name
  It is used internally as a structural separator, using it would break routing
* The use of **alphanumeric characters only** (`a‚Äìz`, `A‚ÄìZ`, `0‚Äì9`) is **strongly recommended**
* Wildcards (`*`) are allowed only for internal system use (e.g. pattern-based registration)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è No runtime validation is enforced by the SDK for performance reasons.
> The `name` package is one of the most frequently called components in HydrAIDE ‚Äî adding input validation would 
> slow it down by 10‚Äì20√ó. It is the **developer‚Äôs responsibility** to follow the documented rules.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Constructing a Name

You can create a `name.Name` using fluent chaining:

```go
n := name.New().
    Sanctuary("projects").
    Realm("files").
    Swamp("report-2025-Q1")
```

Or reconstruct one from an existing string path:

```go
n := name.Load("projects/files/report-2025-Q1")
```

This is useful when deserializing names from persisted storage or incoming metadata.

### üß™ Common Patterns

| Use case          | Sanctuary | Realm    | Swamp         |
| ----------------- |----------| -------- | ------------- |
| User profiles     | users    | profiles | user-123      |
| Game achievements | games    | unlocked | level-10-boss |
| Analytics         | domains  | ai       | example.com   |
| Chat rooms        | chat     | room     | room-42       |
| Queued tasks      | tasks    | catalog  | main          |

These names are used consistently across the SDK, in Catalogs, Profiles, event subscriptions, locking, routing, and more.

### üîê Island Mapping

To determine where data should physically reside, you can use:

```go
island := name.GetIslandID(1000) // e.g. returns 774
```

This returns a **1-based index** from 1 to N, based on a fast, collision-resistant `xxhash` of the full path.
All clients using the same `allIslands` count will resolve the same name to the same server ‚Äî even without coordination.

---

### Profiles and Catalogs

The Go SDK offers a simple yet powerful way to manage data through two fundamental patterns: **Profiles** and **Catalogs**.

**Profiles** are designed to represent all structured data related to a single entity ‚Äî for example, a user.
Each user has their own dedicated Profile Swamp, which can store all of their relevant information such as name, avatar, registration date, last login time, and more.
A profile can hold any amount of data ‚Äî but always belongs to exactly one entity (like one user).

üìÑ [`model_profile_example.go`](examples/models/model_profile_example.go)

**Catalogs**, on the other hand, are key‚Äìvalue Swamps where you can store many unique keys ‚Äî each mapped to its own custom value.
This is ideal for scenarios like tracking all registered user IDs, counting how many users exist in total, or displaying a list of users in an admin dashboard.

üìÑ [`model_catalog_example.go`](examples/models/model_catalog_example.go)

In both cases, data is defined using regular Go `struct`s decorated with HydrAIDE field tags.
You work with the data through model-bound methods that make saving, querying, or subscribing extremely simple and intuitive.

Throughout this SDK documentation (except for the Heartbeat example), all model samples are either Profile-based or Catalog-based, reflecting real production patterns.

### üîê Business Logic

The functions under Business Logic enable **cross-cutting coordination** across distributed services.

These are not tied to a specific Swamp or Treasure ‚Äî they operate on shared, logical domains like user balances,
order flows, or transaction states.

- `Lock()` acquires a **blocking distributed lock** for a given domain key to ensure no concurrent execution happens.
- `Unlock()` safely releases it using a provided lock ID.

Use these when you need to **serialize operations** across services or modules.

Ideal for:
- Credit transfers
- Order/payment sequences
- Ensuring consistency during critical logic

| Function | SDK Status | Example Go Models and Docs                                     |

| Unlock   | ‚úÖ Ready | [basics_lock_unlock.go](examples/models/basics_lock_unlock.go) |

---

### üåø Swamp & Treasure

These functions manage the lifecycle and existence of Swamps (data containers) and their Treasures (records),
including registration, validation, destruction, and real-time subscriptions.

| Function        | SDK Status | Example Go Models and Docs                                               |

### üß¨ Profile Swamps

**Profile Swamps** are designed for storing rich, structured data tied to a single unique entity ‚Äî such as a user, website, or property.  
They are optimized for managing heterogeneous fields (e.g., name, timestamps, nested metadata) in a **single logical unit**, addressed by a unique Swamp name.

Unlike Catalogs (which store many entries via keys), Profiles represent **one entity per Swamp**, making them ideal for persistent, reference-level data structures.

#### üìå Common Use Cases

- üë§ A user account with fields like email, avatar, registration date, and login history
- üåê A website‚Äôs core configuration: domain, engine type, description, status
- üè† A real estate listing: square footage, location, type, last updated timestamp
- üß© Any entity that has a stable identity and holds multiple fields under it

#### ‚úÖ Key Characteristics

- üîπ Accessed by **Swamp name**, not key or filter
- üß† Efficient binary format with `hydraide:"omitempty"` support
- üì¶ Supports nested pointer structs and typed primitives
- üîÑ Used for full hydration (ProfileRead) and overwrite (ProfileSave)
- üîê Can be locked at the Swamp level if needed

#### üì¶ Example Use Case: User Profile

```go
user := &UserProfile{UserID: "user-123"}
_ = user.Load(repo) // Hydrates entire profile

user.Email = "new@email.com"
user.Preferences.DarkMode = true
_ = user.Save(repo) // Saves all changes at once
````

Internally, HydrAIDE stores this under a Swamp like:

```
/users/profiles/user-123
```

Each field is stored in binary chunks ‚Äî only if the value is present (thanks to `hydraide:"omitempty"`).

### üóÇÔ∏è Catalog Swamps

**Catalog Swamps** are optimized for storing *structured, queryable lists* of entries ‚Äî such as users, logs, tags, messages, or domain entries ‚Äî where each item follows a common schema and is stored using a **unique key** inside a shared Swamp.

This model fits best when you need to:

* üíæ Store hundreds, thousands, or millions of typed entries
* üîç Query individual entries by key (CatalogRead)
* üìä Filter or stream entries based on time or value (CatalogReadMany)
* ‚úçÔ∏è Write or update entries using predictable logic (Create, Save, Update)
* üß† Keep track of creation/update time and metadata (e.g. who added it)

#### ‚úÖ Key Characteristics

* üîë Accessed by **record key**, within a named Swamp
* üîÅ Supports one-to-many and many-to-many storage patterns
* üìå Highly efficient for *appendable*, *reactive* data types (e.g. events, logs)
* üß© Can use metadata decorators: `createdBy`, `createdAt`, `updatedBy`, `updatedAt`
* üß™ Index-based read operations with configurable order & limit
* üß† Ideal for structured slices, trees, or versioned record lists
  üîÑ Fully reactive: supports real-time streaming via Subscribe()

> üí° Catalog Swamps are the most reactive data structures in HydrAIDE.
> They are the primary targets for Subscribe() operations, making it easy to listen to individual keys (Treasure-level events), filtered value changes, or full Swamp activity.
> This makes Catalogs ideal for building live dashboards, notification systems, audit pipelines, and streaming analytics.

#### üìå Common Use Cases

* üë• **Users catalog** ‚Äì keyed by userID, stores last login, ban status, etc.
* üìì **Notes or messages** ‚Äì keyed by noteID, stores message text, timestamps
* üß† **Tags or references** ‚Äì documents stored under tag-named Swamps
* üìà **Event logs** ‚Äì every entry is append-only, searchable by creation time
* üîê **Lock tables** ‚Äì key is the lock, value is who holds it and until when

#### üì¶ Example: Storing Users in a Catalog

```go
user := &CatalogModelUser{
	UserUUID: "user-123",
	Payload: &Payload{
		LastLogin: time.Now(),
		IsBanned:  false,
	},
	CreatedBy: "auth-service",
	CreatedAt: time.Now(),
}

_ = user.Save(repo) // Upserts the record
```

This stores a Treasure in:

```
/users/catalog/all ‚Üí key: user-123 ‚Üí value: Payload + metadata
```

HydrAIDE will track when and who wrote the data, and can later stream or react to changes over time.

#### üîé Indexed Reads

You can stream entries by time using:

```go
index := &hydraidego.Index{
	IndexType:  hydraidego.IndexCreationTime,
	IndexOrder: hydraidego.IndexOrderDesc,
	Limit:      10,
}
_ = h.CatalogReadMany(ctx, swampName, index, CatalogModelUser{}, func(m any) error { ... })
```

Unlike relational databases, **HydrAIDE builds indexes in memory on-demand** using fast, in-memory hashing ‚Äî reducing storage duplication and ensuring sub-ms reads in hydrated Swamps.
To keep performance high, consider keeping the Swamp in memory longer (e.g. `CloseAfterIdle: 1h`).

---

### üìö Good to Know: Split Catalogs When Needed

While Catalog Swamps are highly scalable, **putting too many entries into a single Swamp** can reduce performance 
‚Äî especially for real-time filtering, event subscriptions, and storage efficiency.

To keep things fast and clean:

> üì¶ **Segment large catalogs into multiple logical Swamps**, based on a meaningful key like prefix, user, region, or time window.

#### üß© Practical Sharding Strategies

| Use Case                | Strategy                         | Swamp Pattern Example                           | Why it Helps                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |-------------------------------------------------| -------------------------------------------------- |
| üåç Millions of tags     | Split by first letter            | `tags/catalog/a`, `tags/catalog/b`, ...         | Limits Swamp size; enables faster reads and writes |
| üë• User session logs    | Split by user ID + month         | `sessions/<userID>/<YYYYMM>`                    | Natural time + user partition; simplifies cleanup  |
| üìà Logs or events       | Split by time or service         | `logs/api/202507`, `logs/db/202507`             | Enables stream isolation and easier archiving      |
| üè∑Ô∏è Document references | Use tag as Swamp name            | `tags/references/ai`, `tags/references/go`      | Natural many-to-many model; easy reverse lookup    |
| üß† Search term tracking | Split by language or word length | `search/terms-en/short`, `search/terms-fr/long` | Reduces per-Swamp memory; isolates data logically  |

#### üí° Design Tip

When deciding on a segmentation scheme, ask:

* üî∏ *Would I ever need to read or stream all entries at once?*
  ‚Üí If not, you can safely split into smaller Swamps.

* üî∏ *Is my query logic scoped to a subset (e.g. one user, one month)?*
  ‚Üí Then use that scope in your Swamp name!

* üî∏ *Will this Catalog grow indefinitely (e.g. logs, metrics)?*
  ‚Üí Use time-based sharding: monthly or weekly Swamps make cleanup easier.

---

#### üìá Shard Index Catalog: Track Your Shards

If you decide to segment a Catalog into multiple Swamps (e.g., by letter, user ID, or month), it's **often helpful to maintain a *central Catalog* that tracks all used shard keys**.

> This way, you always know what Swamps exist ‚Äî even if they were created dynamically.

##### üìå Example: Tag Shard Index

Suppose you split your tag Catalog by starting letter:

* `tags/catalog/a`
* `tags/catalog/b`
* ‚Ä¶
* `tags/catalog/z`

You can maintain a separate Swamp like:

```go
// CatalogModelTagShardIndex represents a known shard for tags.
type CatalogModelTagShardIndex struct {
	Letter string `hydraide:"key"` // e.g. "a", "b", "c", ...
}
```

Then store entries in a central index Swamp:

```go
/tags/shard-index/main
```

This Catalog tells your app which Swamps are known and can be iterated for:

* üß≠ Admin panels that list all existing shards
* ‚öôÔ∏è Cron jobs that clean or export each Swamp
* üìä Dashboards that show per-shard stats

##### üìå Example: Session Logs by Month

For time-based segmentation, you can store a tracker like:

```go
// CatalogModelMonthShardIndex tracks known months used for session storage.
type CatalogModelMonthShardIndex struct {
	YearMonth string `hydraide:"key"` // Format: "2025-07", "2025-08"
}
```

Stored under:

```
/sessions/shard-index/by-month
```

This allows you to:

* Show a list of available months
* Stream sessions per month
* Archive or purge old data confidently

#### üß† Why This Matters

Keeping a central index of used shards gives you:

* üîç Discoverability: You don‚Äôt have to scan disk or guess swamp names
* üõ†Ô∏è Automation: Background jobs can iterate shards easily
* üí° Analytics: You can measure growth per shard
* ‚úÖ Reliability: Safer to purge or process known Swamps

---

#### üßØ When Not to Use Catalogs

Catalogs are not suitable when:

* You only want to store *a single record per Swamp* ‚Üí use **Profiles** instead
* You need to increment or patch partial values ‚Üí use custom logic or ProfileMerge
* You want full relational joins ‚Äî HydrAIDE is NoSQL by design

### ‚ûï Increment / Decrement ‚Äì Atomic State With Metadata Control

HydrAIDE‚Äôs `Increment*` family of functions enables **atomic, type-safe updates** of numeric values ‚Äî without reading, locking, or manually overwriting state.

Whether you're updating:

* a user's **rate limit**,
* a device's **event count**,
* a game **score**,
* a financial **balance**,
* or a processing **threshold**,

‚Ä¶you can do it with **one intent-first operation** ‚Äî optionally guarded by conditions like *‚Äúonly increment if current value < 100‚Äù* **and** optionally applying lifecycle/audit metadata in the same atomic step.

#### üß† Why this is a game-changer:

* ‚ö° **Atomic execution** ‚Äî no race conditions, no read-modify-write logic
* üîí **Treasure-level locking only** ‚Äî never blocks the entire Swamp
* üß¨ **Strongly typed** ‚Äî choose from `int8`, `uint32`, `float64`, etc.
* ‚úÖ **Condition-aware** ‚Äî support for rich comparisons: `Equal`, `NotEqual`, `GreaterThan`, `LessThanOrEqual`, etc.
* üè∑Ô∏è **Metadata control** ‚Äî set `CreatedAt`, `CreatedBy`, `UpdatedAt`, `UpdatedBy`, or `ExpiredAt` depending on whether the Treasure is created or updated

> This isn‚Äôt just math ‚Äî it‚Äôs **concurrent state mutation**, encoded as intention, with audit and TTL control built-in.

#### üìå One demo to rule them all

All `Increment*` functions work the same way ‚Äî only the type changes.

To see a complete example in action (including conditional logic, metadata usage, and memory-only Swamps), check out:

üëâ [Catalog Model Rate Limit Counter](examples/models/increment.go)

This single model demonstrates how to:

* atomically update a counter,
* guard the operation with a relational condition,
* set metadata fields differently for creation vs. update,
* scale to thousands of users with no locks or I/O,
* and reset the state via `Destroy()` or ExpiredAt.

It applies to **all numeric increment types**, from `int8` to `float64`.

#### üí° Metadata parameters

Each `Increment*` function now supports two optional metadata descriptors:

* `setIfNotExist` ‚Äî applied if the Treasure must be created
* `setIfExist` ‚Äî applied if the Treasure already exists

Example fields in `IncrementMetaRequest`:

* `SetCreatedAt` ‚Äî set creation timestamp automatically
* `SetCreatedBy` ‚Äî set creator ID
* `SetUpdatedAt` ‚Äî set update timestamp automatically
* `SetUpdatedBy` ‚Äî set updater ID
* `ExpiredAt` ‚Äî set absolute expiration timestamp

This lets you control creation/update auditing and TTL in the same atomic call.

### Available Increment Functions

| Function         | SDK Status | Example Demo Model                  |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| IncrementInt8    | ‚úÖ Ready    | ‚úÖ `RateLimitCounter` (shared logic) |
| IncrementInt16   | ‚úÖ Ready    | ‚úÖ `RateLimitCounter` (shared logic) |
| IncrementInt32   | ‚úÖ Ready    | ‚úÖ `RateLimitCounter` (shared logic) |
| IncrementInt64   | ‚úÖ Ready    | ‚úÖ `RateLimitCounter` (shared logic) |
| IncrementUint8   | ‚úÖ Ready    | ‚úÖ `RateLimitCounter` (demonstrated) |
| IncrementUint16  | ‚úÖ Ready    | ‚úÖ `RateLimitCounter` (shared logic) |
| IncrementUint32  | ‚úÖ Ready    | ‚úÖ `RateLimitCounter` (shared logic) |
| IncrementUint64  | ‚úÖ Ready    | ‚úÖ `RateLimitCounter` (shared logic) |
| IncrementFloat32 | ‚úÖ Ready    | ‚úÖ `RateLimitCounter` (shared logic) |
| IncrementFloat64 | ‚úÖ Ready    | ‚úÖ `RateLimitCounter` (shared logic) |

> üí° Only the numeric type changes ‚Äî the logic stays the same. The same metadata and condition patterns apply to all variants.

### üìå Slice & Reverse Indexing in HydrAIDE

HydrAIDE provides native support for atomic operations on `[]uint32` slices within Swamps ‚Äî enabling highly efficient and scalable **reverse indexing**.

#### üß† What is a Reverse Index?

A reverse index is a structure that **maps from a value back to its references**.

Instead of storing ‚ÄúProduct X was viewed by User A‚Äù as a one-way event, we store:

```text
‚Üí Product X ‚Üí [UserA, UserB, UserC]
‚Üí Product Y ‚Üí [UserA, UserF]
```

This allows you to instantly answer questions like:

* *Who interacted with this product?*
* *Which users engaged with this tag?*
* *How many users are linked to this entity?*

Reverse indexes are especially powerful when:

* There are **many-to-many** relationships
* You need **fast set membership** or **frequency analytics**
* You want to **avoid full scans** of large datasets

#### üóÇÔ∏è Reverse Index in a Catalog Context

In HydrAIDE, reverse indexes are stored in **Catalog Swamps**, and the key-value logic looks like this:

```
Swamp name:     tags/products/<tag>
Treasure key:   product-ID
Treasure value: []uint32 (user IDs)
```

This gives you:

* One Swamp per tag
* One Treasure per product
* One slice per product: listing all user IDs who interacted

#### üß∞ Available Functions (all in one model-based demo)

HydrAIDE offers atomic, in-place operations for managing `[]uint32` values under each key.
These are implemented **in a single documented Go model**, not as separate files.

| Function Name             | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Uint32SlicePush`         | Adds unique values to a slice (append-only, deduplicated)                 |
| `Uint32SliceDelete`       | Removes values from a slice (with auto-GC for empty Treasures and Swamps) |
| `Uint32SliceSize`         | Returns the number of elements in the slice (slice length)                |
| `Uint32SliceIsValueExist` | Checks whether a specific value exists in a slice                         |

All of these are demonstrated in the [ModelTagProductViewers](examples/models/slice_and_reverse_index.go) Go model, which shows how to:

* Index users under tagged products
* Query reverse relationships
* Manage slice contents atomically and efficiently

#### üöÄ Why it matters

This slice-based reverse indexing system gives you:

* **High performance** (no reads needed for write)
* **Thread safety** (atomic updates)
* **Real-time cleanup** (empty slices and Swamps vanish instantly)
* **Minimal storage footprint** (no duplication, no bloat)

Whether you're building recommender systems, behavioral logs, or tag-driven interactions,
this is HydrAIDE's way of giving you **database-native reverse sets**, without the overhead of external joins or slow full scans.
