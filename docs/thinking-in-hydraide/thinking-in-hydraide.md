# 🧐 Thinking in HydrAIDE - A More Natural Way to Handle Real-Time Data

---

## Why I Built HydrAIDE

I’ve been programming for almost 30 years. More than 10 of those years were deep in old-school software engineering, 
writing highly concurrent systems in Go, especially for high-load backend services.

Then in 2021, we started building a startup called [Trendizz.com](https://trendizz.com). 
The goal? Help businesses find the best possible B2B partners across Europe, but with precise micro-segmentation. 

That meant answering questions like:

> “Which companies in Europe sell bicycles, don’t yet ship with GLS, and run an Unas web store?”

To do that, we needed to crawl and index millions of websites. Not just metadata, we needed exact word matches, 
across multiple layers of content, at massive-scale.

And that’s where the real challenge began.

We quickly realized that **no existing database** could handle what we were trying to do.
And we didn’t have a multi-million dollar infrastructure budget to brute-force it. But the data still had to be processed.

We tried everything: SQL, NoSQL, document stores, graph engines, even the more exotic stuff.

* SQL? Too slow once you go beyond hundreds of millions of records. Query optimization quickly turns into a career.
* NoSQL? Most of them assume everything can live in memory. Not an option when your dataset hits terabytes.
* Cloud solutions? Not even a question. The egress costs alone would’ve bankrupted us. And we needed full control.

So we knew one thing:

**We had to think differently.**

Instead of following the usual patterns, I went back to first principles.

Most modern databases are still based on the assumptions of the early 2000s: single-core CPUs, spinning disks, batch processing.

But what if we took a different approach?

* Today’s M.2 SSDs like the Samsung 990 Pro have insane read/write performance.
* RAM is fast and cheap.
* Modern CPUs handle concurrency beautifully.

So I asked myself:

> Why should everything always live in memory?
> Why can’t I control hydration directly from code?
> What if I just saved everything in small binary files, and used naming patterns to jump to them instantly?

If I already know the folder and file name, that’s a constant-time lookup — `O(1)` access.

So I built a prototype. It wasn’t just fast — it was shockingly memory-efficient. Even with millions of records.

That’s when I knew I had something real.

---

From there, I defined a few non-negotiable rules. These became the pillars of what HydrAIDE had to be:

* **Code-first structure**: If I can’t define everything from Go, I won’t use it. No dashboards, no YAMLs.
* **Queryless**: I don’t want to learn another DSL. Neither does anyone else.
* **Realtime by default**: I build reactive systems and microservices. I don’t want to set up Kafka or Redis just to get updates.
* **Ephemeral indexing**: Indexes shouldn’t live on disk or slow things down. SSDs are fast enough to make most static indexes unnecessary.
* **Garbage-free**: When I delete something, it should be gone. No background jobs. No daemons. No sweeping.
* **Scale with naming**: Orchestration shouldn’t require extra servers. If I can name where something lives, I can scale it, folder by folder.
* **Stateless nodes**: Every node should be fully stateless. That’s how you get portability, scalability, and true fault tolerance.

So no! I didn’t want just another database.
I needed a **real-time, reactive, code-native engine** that worked the way my mind works.

That’s why HydrAIDE was born.

And the rest? Well, that was just two years of building, testing, rewriting... and finally seeing it work in production.

So if you’ve ever felt like databases just get in your way, keep reading.

## What You Should Know Before Writing Code

HydrAIDE has its own logic, and it pays off to learn the flow before diving into SDKs.

Here’s the sequence we recommend:
