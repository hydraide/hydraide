# ! If these values do not match how your client connects to the server
#    (e.g. IP, Docker hostname, domain name),
#    then TLS verification will fail and the connection will be rejected.

# > Example: if your client connects to the server at 192.168.0.10,
#    you MUST list that IP here as "IP.x = 192.168.0.10".
# > If your client connects via a DNS name like "api.mycompany.com",
#    that DNS name MUST also appear here.
#
# > You can list both IP addresses and DNS names.
