# Contributing to HydrAIDE

Thanks for your interest in contributing.  
HydrAIDE is a production-ready system, what we're building now is the SDK and tooling ecosystem around it.

We value clean, well-thought-out work. Whether you're improving documentation, shaping an SDK, 
or refining CLI behavior, your contribution matters.

---

## Quickstart

1. Fork the repository

2. Create a feature or fix branch  
   ‚Üí **Use the branch specified in the task or its parent issue.**  
   ‚Üí If in doubt, ask before starting work.

3. Before you begin working:
  - **Check if someone is already assigned or working on the task** (look for assignees or comments).
  - If it's free, **comment on the issue** to say you're starting work.
  - Please include an **estimated date** when you expect to open the PR (even if approximate).  
    ‚Üí This helps avoid duplication and gives others visibility on progress.
  - If your task is blocking others, please **help them estimate when they can begin** based on your timeline.

4. Make your changes

5. Open a Pull Request  
   ‚Üí **Target the correct development branch**, not `main` unless explicitly stated.  
   ‚Üí Most features are merged into a dedicated SDK or CLI branch, and later batched into `main`.

6. We'll review and respond. Usually within a day or two.


If you're new to HydrAIDE, feel free to:

- Start with a [Contributor Application](https://github.com/hydraide/hydraide/issues/new?template=contributor-application.yml) issue
- Ask for guidance on Discord: [https://discord.gg/xE2YSkzFRm](https://discord.gg/xE2YSkzFRm)
- Explore the [HydrAIDE Knowledge Engine](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-688779751c988191b975beaf7f68801d-hydraide-knowledge-engine) to better understand the system

## üöÄ Demo Applications & Model examples

Explore ready-to-run demo applications built in Go to better understand the HydrAIDE Go SDK and its unique data modeling approach.

- All demo apps are located in the [Example Applications in Go](https://github.com/hydraide/hydraide/tree/main/docs/sdk/go/examples/applications) folder.
- Model Examples [CRUD operations, subscriptions, etc.](https://github.com/hydraide/hydraide/tree/main/docs/sdk/go/examples/models)
- Full Go SDK Documentation: [Go SDK Documentation](docs/sdk/go/go-sdk.md)

These examples are a great starting point to learn how to:

* Structure your HydrAIDE-powered services
* Use profile and catalog models
* Handle real-time, reactive data flows efficiently

---

## Project Layout

- Docs: `/docs`
- SDKs: `sdk/<language>`
- Examples: `/docs/sdk/<language>/examples`
- Main Applications: 
  - HydrAIDE Core: `app/core`
  - HydrAIDE Server: `app/hydraideserver`
  - HydrAIDE CLI: `app/hydraidectl`

Please follow the Go SDK as a reference for structure, naming, and documentation style. SDK `.md` files should be 
clear, parseable, and contain example code.

## Looking for a Task?

- Check the **pinned issues** ‚Äî these are the main areas we're actively working on, and help is always welcome there
- Browse issues labeled [`help wanted`](https://github.com/hydraide/hydraide/issues?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22) ‚Äî these are larger or strategic tasks
- See if there‚Äôs any [`good first issue`](https://github.com/hydraide/hydraide/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) available ‚Äî smaller, self-contained starters
- Or, if you have your own idea, feel free to open a new issue and suggest it

---

## Commit Style

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) when possible:

- `fix: handle empty Swamp hydration`
- `feat: add TTL support to Python SDK`
- `docs: clarify Catalog usage`

---

## ‚úÖ PR Style (Conventional Commits-alap√∫)

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to format pull request titles.
This helps us **automatically assign labels**, generate changelogs, and maintain consistent history.

### ‚úÖ Allowed PR title prefixes:

| Prefix      | Purpose                                  | Example                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `fix:`      | Bugfix, unexpected behavior              | `fix: handle empty Swamp hydration`       |
| `feat:`     | New feature or capability                | `feat: add TTL support to Python SDK`     |
| `docs:`     | Documentation-only change                | `docs: clarify Catalog usage`             |
| `refactor:` | Internal code change, no behavior change | `refactor: simplify hydration handler`    |
| `chore:`    | Build system, tooling, or meta change    | `chore: update GitHub Actions matrix`     |
| `test:`     | Adding or updating tests                 | `test: add coverage for Catalog shifting` |
| `style:`    | Code formatting, whitespace, linter      | `style: reformat SDK with gofumpt`        |
| `perf:`     | Performance-related improvement          | `perf: optimize hydration loop`           |

### ‚ùå Avoid vague or non-standard titles:

* ‚úó `Update stuff`
* ‚úó `bugfix`
* ‚úó `Final version`
* ‚úó `Quick fix`

### üìå Additional Guidelines:

* Always use the prefix **in the PR title**, not just in commit messages.
* The prefix is **case-insensitive** but we recommend lowercase for consistency.
* Draft PRs are welcome, but please use the prefix already when opening.

---

## Testing

- All code should run locally without errors
- Add tests for logic-heavy functions

If you're adding an SDK method, include a simple usage test (call + assert expected result).

## ‚ö° Benchmarking

For changes in `app/core` or `app/server`, benchmarking is **strongly recommended** ‚Äî especially for critical 
functions or logic that runs frequently. HydrAIDE is optimized for speed, and performance regressions must be avoided.

Include `Benchmark*` tests when relevant.
Use `go test -bench .` to measure impact.

---

## Pre-commit Hooks

We use [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/) to run our pre-commit hooks automatically on every Pull Request.  
It handles formatting, linting, and basic validation ‚Äî and can fix issues automatically by committing changes to your PR.

To run hooks locally before committing:

```bash
uv tool install pre-commit
# or
pipx install pre-commit
```
Then activate hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
Run all hooks:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## AI-assisted Contributions

We welcome contributors who learn and build with tools like ChatGPT or Claude. They can help accelerate learning and simplify tasks.
That said, **HydrAIDE is a human-centered system**: we care deeply about intentional design and domain understanding.

If you're using AI to assist your contribution:

* ‚úÖ **Allowed** for documentation writing, task summaries, tooling, CLI improvements, test coverage, and other minor enhancements
(but always read, review, and understand the output fully before submitting)
* ‚ùå **Not allowed** for HydrAIDE Core, Server internals, Swamp mechanics, or SDK infrastructure
  *(unless explicitly discussed and understood)*
* **You must understand the code you submit.** If it‚Äôs AI-generated, make sure you can explain it line by line.
* Please add a note in your PR description if it was AI-assisted (e.g., "Generated with Claude").

We‚Äôre not anti-AI. We just want to ensure that all code reflects human understanding!
HydrAIDE wasn‚Äôt generated by a tool, and we believe that matters.

If you're learning through contribution, that's perfect. Just be transparent, and feel free to ask questions.
We‚Äôll mentor you with pleasure.

Thank you for supporting HydrAIDE, and welcome to the team.
