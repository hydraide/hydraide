"""
Provides a deterministic naming convention for HydrAIDE, helping developers
structure and resolve data into a three-level hierarchy:
Sanctuary → Realm → Swamp.

This structure enables:
- O(1) access to data based on name
- Stateless client-side routing in multi-server setups
- Predictable folder and server mapping without orchestrators

Each Name is constructed step-by-step (Sanctuary → Realm → Swamp),
and the full path can be retrieved using get(). Additionally,
get_island_id(all_folders) maps the current name to a consistent
server index (1-based), using a fast and collision-resistant hash.

Example usage:
    name = Name().sanctuary("users").realm("profiles").swamp("alice123")
    print(name.get())  # "users/profiles/alice123"
    print(name.get_island_id(1000))  # e.g. 774

Use load(path) to reconstruct a Name from an existing path string.

This package is used across HydrAIDE SDKs to:
- Determine data placement
- Support distributed architectures
- Enforce clean, intention-driven naming

class Name:
    """
    Defines a structured identifier used in HydrAIDE to deterministically
    map data into a distributed, folder-based architecture.

    Each Name represents a three-level hierarchy:
        Sanctuary → Realm → Swamp

    This structure is essential for:
    - Organizing Swamps into logical domains
    - Generating predictable folder paths
    - Assigning each Swamp to a specific folder without coordination

    The interface supports fluent chaining:
        name = Name().sanctuary("users").realm("profiles").swamp("alice123")
        name.get() # "users/profiles/alice123"
        name.get_island_id(100) # e.g. 42

    Usage of get_island_id ensures even distribution of data across N folders,
    enabling stateless multi-node architectures without external orchestrators.

        """
        Returns the deterministic, 1-based ID of the Island where this Name
        physically resides.

        An Island is HydrAIDE’s smallest migratable physical unit — a
        deterministic storage zone that groups one or more Swamps under the
        same hash bucket. The result of this function is used to determine
        which HydrAIDE server should store the Swamp represented by this Name.

        The IslandID is calculated using a fast, consistent xxhash over the
        combined SanctuaryID, RealmName, and SwampName. The hash value is
        mapped into the provided `all_islands` range, which must be
        consistent across all clients and routers to ensure predictable
        behavior.

        📦 What is an Island?
        - A logical+physical storage unit that lives as a top-level folder
          (e.g. /data/234/)
        - The place where a Swamp is anchored
        - A fixed destination for a given SwampName, regardless of
          infrastructure changes

        🌐 Why does this matter?
        - Enables decentralized routing without coordination
        - Makes server assignments stateless and predictable
        - Supports seamless migration (moving Islands ≠ renaming Swamps)

        🚫 This function should not be used directly by application code.
        It is intended for SDK-internal routing logic.

        Example:
            island_id = name.get_island_id(1000)
            # client = router.route(island_id)

        💡 If you update the hash space (all_islands), all previous
        IslandID mappings change. Keep `all_islands` fixed across your
        system lifetime for stable routing.
